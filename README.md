- 👋 Hi, I’m @SunnyMayo, or Mason in the real world! I'm from Sydney, Australia.

- 👀 I’m interested in building out my computer science skillset and knowledge, and gaining experience with different technologies and languages.

- 🌱 I’m currently learning a bit of everything, riding a wave of enthusiasm over the past few months. I have a strong interest in Data, and have been learning SQL and Python (Pandas / some MatPlotLib), and have recently been refreshing myself in HTML, CSS and JS. I recently undertook the CS50 online course offered through edX and Harvard, which was a great foundation for Computer Science in general.

- 💞️ I am not looking to collaborate at this time, but would be more than happy to offer my two cents or input if anyone ever wanted it!

- 📫 How to reach me: You're already on my GitHub page, that's as good a place as any!

- 😄 Pronouns: He/Him

- ⚡ Fun fact: I have an Encyclopedic knowledge of Bluey 🐶
